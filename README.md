# VicDamSimu

VicDamSimu is a real-time dam simulation program developed using Python and Pygame.

## Description

This program simulates the flow of water through a dam structure in real-time, allowing users to interact with the simulation by adjusting the height of the dam. It visualizes the water flow using graphical elements and provides a simple interface for users to control the simulation.

## Features

- Real-time simulation of water flow through a dam structure.
- Interactive control of dam height using keyboard inputs.
- Visualization of water flow and dam structure using Pygame graphics.
- Adjustable simulation parameters for customization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Dhahlan3890/Real-time_spillway_Simulation-VictoriaDam.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the simulation:

    ```
    python VicDamSimu.py
    ```

## Usage

- Press the **up arrow key** to increase the height of the dam and simulate water flow.
- Press the **down arrow key** to decrease the height of the dam and reduce water flow.
- Click the **Simulate** button to start or stop the simulation.
